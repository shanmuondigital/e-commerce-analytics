**E-Commerce Analytics on Sales Data:**

**Problem Statement:**
The E-Commerce Analytics project aimed to scrutinize sales and web data within Tableau, with a primary focus on understanding customer relationships and identifying potential revenue leaks for a startup. Recognizing the criticality of an early customer base, the investigation sought to unravel any unnoticed issues affecting customer retention and revenue generation.

**Observations and Findings:**
Upon delving into the sales and web data, several critical observations surfaced:

**Customer Relationship Insights:** The analysis revealed distinct patterns in customer behavior, highlighting the significance of certain customer segments. It became evident that certain valuable customers had ceased engagement due to product discontinuation.

**Unnoticed Revenue Impact:** The correlation between discontinued products and customer churn underscored an unexpected revenue leak. This oversight in product discontinuation led to the loss of valuable customers, impacting revenue streams without being noticed initially.

**Impact on Startup's Early Customer Base: ** The identified loss of valuable customers due to product discontinuation poses a substantial threat to the stability and growth of the startup. Retaining early adopters is pivotal for establishing a loyal customer base and securing sustained revenue.

These findings underscore the need for a proactive approach in product management and customer retention strategies. Addressing product discontinuations and mitigating their impact on valuable customer segments are crucial steps in fortifying the startup's foundation and ensuring sustainable growth.
